## Mission and Scope

The Outreach Committee (OC) is the place where the community comes together, including the projects, the members, and the ambassadors with the goal to identify opportunities to help market and communicate CDF's projects, SIGs, working groups, etc messages (new releases, need for contributors, etc.) within the CDF community and to the broader technical community in general. The Outreach Chair acts as the communication link between the board and the rest of the community.




## Members

Members of the Outreach Committee should consist of one representative from each member company at the Premier, General and End User membership levels as well as one representative for all adopted CDF projects and the Ambassador chair. This will make up the voting board to be led with direction from the Outreach Committee Chair. Additional project and community members may attend Outreach Committee meetings in a non-voting capacity. Members will be expected to contribute to initiatives aimed at growing the CDF community and supporting CDF projects.
